\begin{itemize}
  \item{
      Success
    }
  \item{
      A number unforeseen extensions completed
    }
  \item{
      Learned more about compression in NN.
    }
  \item{
      Devised a method that should better estimate how NN retain MI.
    }
\end{itemize}

\section{Looking Back}
\begin{itemize}
  \item{
      I have underestimated the importance of subtle details
    }
  \item{
      Not understanding the theory fully I made preventable mistakes, and wrong
      assumptions that lead to misleading conclusions.
    }
  \item{
      I implemented code for mutual information estimation with out
      understanding the importance of noise and compression.
    }
  \item{
      If were to reimplement the code again I would first derive a mathematical
      model of how theory heavy parts are expected to work, then try to
      implement the maths as closely as possible. Rather than just thinking how
      it works and trying to keep everything in my head.
    }
\end{itemize}

\section{Further Work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item{
      Further work needs to be done MI estimation.
    }
  \item{
      The MIE Tishby used is very primitive. 
    }
  \item{
      The MIE used by Saxe is more complex and captures more details, but is
      still a basic estimator
    }
  \item{
      It would be great to see work being done on NN specific estimators that
      take into account properties specific to NNs
    }
  \item{
      I believe that before we get better tools we cannot ask questions about
      the "phases" a NN is in such as the "Compression Phase" and "Memorization
      Phase" as mentioned in \autoref{subVIZ}.
